# SpriterDotNet
A simple, fast and efficient Spriter implementation in pure C#

**Coming Soon - Code cleanup in progress**

## About
Being a pure C# implementation, SpriterDotNet doesn't depend on any external libraries / frameworks. It focuses on simple and efficient calculations of all transforms at a given point in time. This allows using it with any framework just by mapping calculated transforms to concrete objects.

## Features
The goal of SpriterDotNet is to be as fast as possible while keeping the code clean and readable.
